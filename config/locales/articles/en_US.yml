# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

      Laastras AORI, that is, Acquire or Integrate, aims to meet globalization challenges and constraints so as to achieve
      both national and world unity. Integrate means that your enterprise affiliates Laastras so as to consume our services
      in terms of management of your business. After a while, if interested, Laastras acquires your enterprise so that
      you become a shareholder with all rights reserved to Laastras. One other crucial condition for acquiring your business
      is that every employee in your enterprise must be remunerated for their job (service) with the right to all Laastras services.
      You then decide how much cash (any currency, Virtual Currency included) to pay them for the other missing services.

            We have done trade for ages. The trade model has failed to give us financial security
            coupled with self-sufficiency. Let alone conflicts that result from attempts to secure
            and retain control of our businesses. We went a step further&#58; philanthropy. We believed it
            could end poverty and give us all equal opportunities. It won't work either. Until Laastras
            trade model is adopted we cannot surround ourselves with financial security, self-sufficiency,
            equal opportunities, satisfying employment for all, and conflict-free businesses. How so?
            Laastras reforms trade by way of two impacts:

                unlocks remuneration through all the other 
                services in Morshux, yielding financial security and self-sufficiency. Gone are business
                conflicts, too.
            </li>
            <li style=\u0022padding: 10px\u0022>
                Replace material currency with 
                <a href=\u0022/services/e_card?locale=en_US\u0022 style=\u0022text-decoration: none\u0022>
                    Virtual Currency
                </a>. 
                With Morshux self-sufficiency, one is
                better positioned to release their full potential through creativity over Morshux owned 
                assets. We then export those assets through trade that uses Virtual Currency, which is
                more flexible, easy to transact with, secure enough, and fits well in E-commerce and

                software technologies. He was able to on-board into a new language and a new framework 
                in just a few weeks and he was very quickly effective for us! Obed is passionate 
                about software, takes direction well and has a unique ability to solve hard software 
                problems quickly.

                passport, driver's licence, and more, paving the way for World Federal Government.

            Let us assume that “food source and water” as well as “communication as a service” 
            cooperatives are running as need. We have data in the cloud and enough 
            computation power to orchestrate the delivery of goods and services to every person involved in 
            Laastras. For example, we know who needs what, where, and when. Should we 
            order from abroad or should we just increase production? This encourages trade 
            and equips everyone with what to deal in, freely. This cooperative is named 
            “free trade capability” and uses logistics infrastructures and equipment to 
            help up achieve Laastras vision. In the end, the local trade system cloud 
            can communicate with the clouds in the rest of the world. If you run logistics 
            infrastructures, please, consider

            This service is termed AORI (Acquire or Integrate). The integrate part requires that 
            your enterprise uses our transaction portal. Acquire means that we fuse our enterprises,
            making it a bigger whole. Why so? Our society is getting more and more divided 
            economically, creating a deep and wide gap amongst us all. We have come to feel 
            so uncertain about our wealth even when we have it. Alliances, especially, through 
            the “creator economy” are our only safety belt. These alliances get easier using 
            the power of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT). Why would you

            if you feel economically stable and secure? Could you reassure anyone about your 
            financial security? How much do you invest in security and stability? How much personal toll 
            does it take? Again, no help in matters beyond our control is ever going to get to us 
            unless we reach a global alliance, the kind that ends poverty, unemployment, inequality, etc.

                AORI
            </a>
            aims for globalization and does not necessarily steer the flagship towards the 
            Services Exchange milestone. Morshux, however, adds a level of precision to AORI to make 
            sure the enterprises targetted are the kind that can yield “Self-Contained Personal Space (SCoPS)”.
            They must ultimately create a conglomerate called 
            “management of resources that support human existence (Morshux)”. The goal is: You need a single 
            job in Morshux to get everything else that you need to live a healthy and wholesome life. 
            In this case, the currency is dully named “Services Exchange”, as opposed to 
            <a href=\u0022/services/e_card?locale=en_US\u0022 style=\u0022text-decoration: none\u0022>

            Morshux will get us financial security, self-sufficiency, conflict-free 
            businesses, equality, justice, etc. Simply put, life. So, if you are already consuming 
            our AORI services, may you not jump ship. If you are not,

                <div>There was so much silence we felt so overwhelmed </div>
                <div>In between the silence, breezes, sounds, and a heartbeat </div>
                <div>Then trek, trek, trek, that big space pulling us away </div>
                <div>Tongue-tied, but with the head full of words</div>
                <div>Nature could speak to us, we knew it as a fact</div>
                <div>Was I alone, I could not tell, but I saw no one </div>
                <div>Beasts and animals could stare at us </div>
                <div>Should we have panicked, there was no reason for us to </div>
                <div>The fog of mystery dissipated as days flew</div>
                <div>We learned and did things as taught ones</div>
                <div>As if a scroll was unfolding, guiding our steps</div>
                <div>The void in our knowledge was clear evidence </div>
                <div>That there would be a long journey ahead of us.</div>

                <div>Loneliness became a thing of the past </div>
                <div>A feeling I could not recognize anymore</div>
                <div>I felt drawn and lost control of my stance</div>
                <div>Then words filled my head and I uttered them </div>
                <div>Sadly, we grew weary of each other, afterwards</div>

                <div>The fact is we must find our path, each on their own </div>
                <div>We yelled, calling out to each other </div>
                <div>But our voices struck against one another </div>
                <div>In such a loud noise that no voice was heard at all!</div>

                <div>We built cities and forged tools to alleviate the load </div>
                <div>Hunting started as we felt they were a part of eats</div>
                <div>Fights, bickering, quarelling drew us apart again and again </div>
                <div>Dead bodies on thoroughfares told the stories</div>
                <div>Of what was happening as people went about their work</div>

                <div>We could see marks of civilizations as they had existed </div>

                Full NDA. They have constantly denied me jobs, even internship. They claim I must be a part of a bigger
                organization, or else there shall be no support at all, oh, except from some very specific groups 
                that they might be planning to destroy, damage, or annihilate. They have been pressuring me to 
                join any of those political or religious groups. In the process, they have attempted to kill my wife, 
                to decimate my entire family lineage, and are working hard to keep me isolated without any social,
                economical, or psychological support. They have labelled me a bipolar disorder patient, a condition
                they design through neuro-toxic attacks, chemicals that they might be mixing with my food in restaurants, at shops,
                pubs, even at the market, due to meager finances. They might be making strategic attacks on my sex life to make 
                sure my marriage gets destroyed and make even next marriages impossible.

                Biological weapons. At the Catholic Church, at the 20th street, Bubanza, Kinama, Bujumbura-Mairie, 
                Burundi, I might have been undergoing subtle biological attacks. The milk restaurant agents seem to be 
                feeding me with neuro-toxic chemicals mixed with either milk or cooking oil. The chemicals seem 
                to be reacting with other biological and electromagnetic weapons that they might have spread around 
                in my neighborhood. They might have recently targetted my brain in an attempt to cause brain tumor,
                and my heart to cause a permanent heart disease. They force me to hear one message: 
                call your soldiers to rescue you. Obviously they want to forcibly involve a government and impose 
                upon me a strategy of their own, like for example, Laastras must start in Burundi as a test site.

                Starting April 2021, I started the official marketing campaign of Laastras project. I have ever since contacted
                Burundi government and multiple Embassies in Burundi. I informed the Office of Burundi President, 
                the Head of Burundi Parliament, the Burundi Minister of Finances, the OSESG in Bujumbura-Burundi. The Ambassadors
                of these countries to Burundi were also informed by letter: USA, France, China, Germany, Belgium, Russia, UK, 
                Switzerland, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, DRC, Tanzania, Somalia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. The 
                following NGO's were also informed by letter: Save the Children and World Vision. Included in 
                informed institutions is OBEM (Office of Burundi for Employment and Manpower).

                If any condition ensues that makes my responsibilities impossible, you will then conduct the needed 
                black operations without revealing your identity. The operations must 
                start with the military assassination of the guilty Head of State and his/her family. Followed by a period 
                of 30 days to give (without a word) an opportunity to everyone else to evacuate to another chosen country of refuge. 
                If it is Burundi, the guilty nation, Burundi people must flee to Kenya. No other country in the 
                region is allowed to grant them refuge. Refugees must flee using their own means. There must not 
                be any help whatsoever in the matter. Afterwards, every breathing thing on the guilty country 
                soil must be destroyed. The nation area must forever remain lifeless until I come back from the dead.

                It is a formatter or reshaper of the local government into Laastras,
                the government becoming, in the end, one of Laastras cooperatives, named
                “legal protection of the self-contained personal space”. It is more 
                convenient than a brutal change of constitution and leaves the local government 
                alone enough to continue with their mission as a sovereign nation or kingdom. Thus, the 
                government will meet the requirements for a State of the World Federal Government.

            Convincing governments to set up <strong>Spefodem</strong> is not as easy as it seems. Those guys tend to be 
            very haughty and arrogant. Plus, they are bathed in too much apparent satisfaction. We will 
            then count on fund donors and investors who, through marketing strategies, will come to

            <div style=\u0022margin: 10px\u0022>
                Laastras is a project that purposes to preserve peace in our country and all over the world.
                First and foremost, it is crucial that people have peace in the stomach. Many a time, quarels 
                and fights result from starvation and ill health that stems from malnutrition. As the old Burundi 
                adage goes “Mu nda harara inzara hakazinduka inzigo”, that is, literally, “When you go to bed hungry
                you will wake up enraged”. “LaasEgrocery” is the core branch of Laastras project. To reduce the cost
                to a minimum, we will lead customers to shops with a list of groceries that nourish their health.
                That will give us insights into their nutrition needs. We will distribute customers to traders and 
                arrange for regular orders from suppliers. All of the three groups will be sources of revenue. 
                The revenue will sustain “LaasEgrocery” and fund the other remaining branches of Laastras project:
                “LaasEcard” (HoFi cell phone), “LaasElogistics”, and “LaasEalliances” (AORI).

                For example, parents cannot divide children, per se. For the children to have both parents,
                the parents must raise them together under the same roof. Step parents cannot replace biological

                Divorce can be energy and time consuming. It disrupts peace and development. Laastras project 
                values family, married couples, and children. To be proactive, and since statistics prove that 
                divorce or near-divorce rate is too high, this contract is divorce-oriented. It makes provisions 
                that arm family with policy, protocols, and strategies that will keep family safe even in case 
                of divorce or near-divorce.
