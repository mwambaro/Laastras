# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

      A collection of internet of our things (IoT) services that aim at fulfilling leadership as a service (LaaS)
      policy. 'Our things' are all resources that support human existence. To eradicate unemployment, poverty, and
      conflicts, as well as social inequalities, Laastras (one of LaaS applications) must define, build, and
      establish a trade system that allows all humankind to equally benefit from 'our things'.
  "
  opg_site_meta_description: "Business financial security, self-sufficiency,  and no bankruptcy"

  vision_terms: "
      We have done trade for ages. The trade model has failed to give us financial security
      coupled with self-sufficiency. Let alone conflicts that result from attempts to secure
      and retain control of our businesses. We went a step further&#58; philanthropy. We believed it
      could end proverty and give us all equal opportunities. It won't work either. Until Laastras
      trade model is adopted we cannot surround ourselves with financial security, self-sufficiency,
      equal opportunities, satisfying employment for all, and conflict-free businesses. How so?
      Laastras reforms trade by way of two impacts:
      <br><br>
      <ul>
      <li>
         Replace remuneration-based work with Services Exchange. One job related to 'management
         of resources that support human existence' (Morshux) unlocks remuneration through all the other 
         services in Morshux, yielding financial security and self-sufficiency. Gone are business
         conflicts, too.
      </li>
      <li>
         Replace material currency with Virtual Currency. With Morshux self-sufficiency, one is
         better positioned to release their full potential through creativity over Morshux owned 
         assets. We then export those assets through trade that uses Virtual Currency, which is
         more flexible, easy to transact with, secure enough, and fits well in E-commerce and 
         Logistics, pillars of any trade.
      </li>
      </ul>
      
      Laastras is built on the principle of 'Internet of <u> our </u> Things' (IooT) and delivers services 
      that will, in the long run, fulfil the Morshux vision. For details on the Morshux 
      philosophy, please, support the project by buying

  mission_terms: "
      Meet globalization challenges and constraints by leveraging the power of Internet of our Things (IoT).
      Equality policy on global resources, Logistics, E-commerce, Leadership as a Service (LaaS),
      Communication as a Service (CaaS), and Legal Protection as a Service (PraaS) can turn malls, shops, 
      and market places into trans-shipment warehouses and divert manpower therein to actual production. 
      This IoT will then curb unemployment, poverty, and conflicts. Welcome to Laastras (LaaS trade system), 
      a collection of IoT services that lead to a world of plenty for all. Our money is Services Exchange, 
      on one side, and Virtual Money, on the other. We agree to disagree on everything else but one unrefutable 
      truth: We must equally share all resources that support our existence, present and future, discovered and 
      yet to be found. Laastras collection of IoT services offer the best policy to achieve that truth.
