# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization

# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:

# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.

      Laastras AORI, that is, Acquire or Integrate, aims to meet globalization challenges and constraints so as to achieve
      both national and world unity. Integrate means that your enterprise affiliates Laastras so as to consume our services
      in terms of management of your business. After a while, if interested, Laastras acquires your enterprise so that
      you become a shareholder with all rights reserved to Laastras. One other crucial condition for acquiring your business
      is that every employee in your enterprise must be remunerated for their job (service) with the right to all Laastras services.
      You then decide how much cash (any currency, Virtual Currency included) to pay them for the other missing services.

      <p>
      We have done trade for ages. The trade model has failed to give us financial security
      coupled with self-sufficiency. Let alone conflicts that result from attempts to secure
      and retain control of our businesses. We went a step further&#58; philanthropy. We believed it
      could end poverty and give us all equal opportunities. It won't work either. Until Laastras
      trade model is adopted we cannot surround ourselves with financial security, self-sufficiency,
      equal opportunities, satisfying employment for all, and conflict-free businesses. How so?
      Laastras reforms trade by way of two impacts:
      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>
         Replace remuneration-based work with Services Exchange. One job related to 'management
         of resources that support human existence' (Morshux) unlocks remuneration through all the other 
         services in Morshux, yielding financial security and self-sufficiency. Gone are business
         conflicts, too.
      </li>
      <li>
         Replace material currency with Virtual Currency. With Morshux self-sufficiency, one is
         better positioned to release their full potential through creativity over Morshux owned 
         assets. We then export those assets through trade that uses Virtual Currency, which is
         more flexible, easy to transact with, secure enough, and fits well in E-commerce and 
         Logistics, pillars of any trade.
      </li>
      </ul>
